# Security Information and Event Management
## What does it do?
Software to analyse activity across a network.
It collects data from network devices (e.g Servers) and analyses to discover trends, detect threats and create alerts.

## How do they work?
Collect log and event data generated by other devices (Including things like Firewalls and Antivirus) and collecting it all in a central platform.

Sorts data into categories identifies which activity could be a threat.

Each threat is flagged with a priority to signify which events are more likely to be genuine attacks.

For example 10 attempts in 10 mins would be low priority as it is likely a user who's forgotten their password. However, 100 failed attempts in 5 minutes is likely to be Brute Force attack. and would be marked as high priority.
