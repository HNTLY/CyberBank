# Cross-Site Scripting
## Description
Injection attack exploiting trust from websites and injecting malicious code, typically into javascript forms.

## 3 Types:
### Stored (Persistent)
Injected code is permanently stored on the target server e.g Databases, forums etc.
Victim then receives the script when they request the stored information.

### Reflected
Injected code is reflected off the web server e.g in the form of an error message.
The code is retrieved by the victim through their own demise such as through a malicious link.
The code is executed because it came from a trusted source.

### DOM-Based (Document Object Model-Based)
Code injected into improperly sanitized object based documents e.g HTML.
Modifies the environment of the victims browser. 
The HTTP response doesn't change but the client-side code in the page executes differently. 

## Identification Methods
### Javascript execution through the form
Enter some JS code e.g <script>alert(‘XSS’)</script> and run (such as through a search field or comment submission etc). If an alert box appears displaying XSS, the code has been executed.

### Javascript execution through the URL
If the URL has an editable parameter, such as http://testsite.com/test?id=1, we can replace the 1 with JS code and see if it gets executed.

### Improper input validation

### Un-encoded browser output 

## Cheat Sheet
