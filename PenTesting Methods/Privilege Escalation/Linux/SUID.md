# SUID Binaries
## What are SUID Binaries?
  - Set Owner User ID
  - Type of permission allowing users to execute a file with the permissions of another user 

## Why is this useful in Privilege Escalation?
  1. We get a reverse shell as www-data or a home directory user
  2. We find a binary with SUID permissions for the root user
  3. Find a way to execute that binary maliciously providing us with access as root

## How to implement this method?

  1. Find which binaries can be run as desired user using one of the methods below
  2. Identify which binaries are unusual and could be exploited
  3. Check [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) and see if this is a binary with a SUID vulnerability 
  4. Each binary is different. Some are well-known, some are custom made. Identify what the binary does and how it works to elevate into a executing a shell as the desired user. Some binaries will escalate your current shell, some will need a new listener.

## Finding SUID Binaries

`find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null`
  - `/` denotes start search from root of file system
  - `-perm` search for the following specific permissions
  - `-u=s` look for files owned by root
  - `-type` search for following type of file
  - `f` regular file
  - `2` standard error (stderr)
  - `>` redirection 
  - `/dev/null` filesystem object to throwaway everything written to it
  - The `2>/dev/null` prevents errors from being written to output

`find / -user root -perm -4000 -print 2>/dev/null`

`find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null`

`find / -user root -perm -4000 -exec ls -ldb {} \;`
