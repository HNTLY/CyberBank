# Data Loss Prevention Strategy
## 1. Prioritise Data
Some data is mroe important than others
Important to identify which would cause the biggest problem if it were stolen

## 2. Categorise Data
Choose a simple classification method e.g by user or application etc
Categorise the data using this method
Persistent categorising allows for easy tracking

## 3. Understand when data is at risk
Dependant on the data
Could be at risk during transportation e.g via email or on a USB

## 4. Monitor all data movement
Identify trends and irregularities to understand when data is targeted

## 5. Communicate and develop controls
Use programs to perform checks and fine-tuned controls e.g SIEMs

## 6. Employee training
Ensure users understand how to identify legitimate communications and when someone is trying to use social engineering to gain unauthorised data
